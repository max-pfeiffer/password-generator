# Development Dependencies
# These are the dependencies only needed for development. I choose to have
# clear separation of dependencies needed for running the application in
# production and the dependencies needed for development purposes.
# The development dependencies are not needed in the final production Docker
# image and can be installed separately with this extra file.
